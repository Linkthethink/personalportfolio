## About Me
Hello, my name is Beatrice Li. I have recently embarked on a career change from an e-commerce operations role into the field of quality assurance. In my previous position, I managed 2 international cosmetics brand sites in my previous job, which allowed me to develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, I recognize the growing importance of robust system design and quality assurance. This realization has driven my desire to focus on test automation and enhance the quality of software systems. Iâ€™m eager to leverage my background in ecommerce operations and my passion for technology to contribute effectively to your team.
