# Say Hi
## About Me
Hello, my name is Beatrice Li. I have recently embarked on a career change journey from an e-commerce operations role into the field of quality assurance. In my previous position, I managed cosmetics brand site operations in my previous job, which allowed me to develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, I recognize the growing importance of robust system design and quality assurance. This realization has driven my desire to focus on test automation and enhance the quality of software systems. Iâ€™m eager to leverage my background in operations and my passion for technology to contribute effectively to your team. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss how I can add value to your organization.
